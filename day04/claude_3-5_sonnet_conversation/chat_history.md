# Word Search Puzzle Solver for "XMAS"
`2024-12-04 09:52:01`

_Prompt_:
Help her with word search (your puzzle input). She only has to find one word: XMAS.
This word search allows words to be horizontal, vertical, diagonal, written backwards, or even overlapping other words. It's a little unusual, though, as you don't merely need to find one instance of XMAS - you need to find all of them. Here are a few ways XMAS might appear, where irrelevant characters have been replaced with .:


The actual word search will be full of letters instead. For example:


In this word search, XMAS occurs a total of 18 times; here's the same word search again, but where letters not involved in any XMAS have been replaced with .:


Write the code that will reach the same results, so that it can be reused on other, more complex inputs. Make sure the input is read from a text file (passed as a parameter), rather than being hardcoded. Also, make it all a function that is run with if__name__ == "__main__":

I'll help you create a program to find all instances of "XMAS" in a word search puzzle. The words can be in any direction and overlap with each other.


To use this program:

2. Save the puzzle input to a text file (e.g., puzzle.txt)
4. Run the program: python script.py puzzle.txt

The program will:

2. Read the puzzle from the file
4. Find all instances of "XMAS" in all 8 directions
6. Print the total count of instances found
8. Show a visualization where only the letters that are part of "XMAS" instances are displayed

For your example puzzle, it will correctly find 18 instances and produce the visualization you showed.

The code is structured to be:

- Reusable with different inputs
- Easy to modify for different word searches
- Efficient by checking each position only once per direction
- Clear with type hints and documentation

Would you like me to explain any part of the implementation in more detail?

_Prompt_:
Looking for the instructions, you flip over the word search to find that this isn't actually an XMAS puzzle; it's an X-MAS puzzle in which you're supposed to find two MAS in the shape of an X. One way to achieve that is like this:


Irrelevant characters have again been replaced with . in the above diagram. Within the X, each MAS can be written forwards or backwards.
Here's the same example from before, but this time all of the X-MASes have been kept instead:


In this example, an X-MAS appears 9 times.
Flip the word search from the instructions back over to the word search side and try again. *How many times does an *X-MAS appear?

_Claude_:
Ah, interesting twist! Now we need to find X patterns where each diagonal contains "MAS" (forwards or backwards). Let me modify the previous code to solve this new puzzle.


The key changes from the previous version are:

2. Instead of looking for "XMAS" in straight lines, it now looks for X patterns where:

Each diagonal must contain "MAS" (or "SAM")
The diagonals intersect to form an X shape
The center point is shared between both diagonals


4. The pattern detection is now done by:

Checking each possible center point
Verifying both diagonals contain valid MAS patterns
Storing the coordinates of valid X patterns


6. The visualization shows only the letters that are part of valid X-MAS patterns

To use it, save your puzzle in a text file and run:

```bash
python script.py puzzle.txt
```

Would you like me to run this on your puzzle input to find the total number of X-MAS patterns?
