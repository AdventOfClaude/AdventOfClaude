_Prompt_:
The Chief Historian is always present for the big Christmas sleigh launch, but nobody has seen him in months! Last anyone heard, he was visiting locations that are historically significant to the North Pole; a group of Senior Historians has asked you to accompany them as they check the places they think he was most likely to visit.
As each location is checked, they will mark it on their list with a star. They figure the Chief Historian must be in one of the first fifty places they'll look, so in order to save Christmas, you need to help them get fifty stars on their list before Santa takes off on December 25th.
Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!
You haven't even left yet and the group of Elvish Senior Historians has already hit a problem: their list of locations to check is currently empty. Eventually, someone decides that the best place to check first would be the Chief Historian's office.
Upon pouring into the office, everyone confirms that the Chief Historian is indeed nowhere to be found. Instead, the Elves discover an assortment of notes and lists of historically significant locations! This seems to be the planning the Chief Historian was doing before he left. Perhaps these notes can be used to determine which locations to search?
Throughout the Chief's office, the historically significant locations are listed not by name but by a unique number called the location ID. To make sure they don't miss anything, The Historians split into two groups, each searching the office and trying to create their own complete list of location IDs.
There's just one problem: by holding the two lists up side by side (your puzzle input), it quickly becomes clear that the lists aren't very similar. Maybe you can help The Historians reconcile their lists?
For example:
3   4
4   3
2   5
1   3
3   9
3   3

Maybe the lists are only off by a small amount! To find out, pair up the numbers and measure how far apart they are. Pair up the smallest number in the left list with the smallest number in the right list, then the second-smallest left number with the second-smallest right number, and so on.
Within each pair, figure out how far apart the two numbers are; you'll need to add up all of those distances. For example, if you pair up a 3 from the left list with a 7 from the right list, the distance apart is 4; if you pair up a 9 with a 3, the distance apart is 6.
In the example list above, the pairs and distances would be as follows:
* The smallest number in the left list is 1, and the smallest number in the right list is 3. The distance between them is 2.
* The second-smallest number in the left list is 2, and the second-smallest number in the right list is another 3. The distance between them is 1.
* The third-smallest number in both lists is 3, so the distance between them is 0.
* The next numbers to pair up are 3 and 4, a distance of 1.
* The fifth-smallest numbers in each list are 3 and 5, a distance of 2.
* Finally, the largest number in the left list is 4, while the largest number in the right list is 9; these are a distance 5 apart.
To find the total distance between the left list and the right list, add up the distances between all of the pairs you found. In the example above, this is 2 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 5, a total distance of 11!
Your actual left and right lists contain many location IDs. What is the total distance between your lists?

_Claude_:
I'll solve this puzzle step by step. This looks like an Advent of Code Day 1 problem, likely from the 2022 or 2023 edition. To calculate the total distance between two lists, I'll need to:

- Sort both lists
- Pair up corresponding elements
- Calculate the absolute difference between paired elements
- Sum these differences

Here's a Python solution to solve this:

```python
def calculate_total_distance(left_list, right_list):
    # Sort both lists
    left_sorted = sorted(left_list)
    right_sorted = sorted(right_list)
    
    # Calculate distances between paired elements
    distances = [abs(left - right) for left, right in zip(left_sorted, right_sorted)]
    
    # Return total distance
    return sum(distances)

# Example from the problem description
left_example = [3, 4, 2, 1, 3, 3]
right_example = [4, 3, 5, 3, 9, 3]
print(calculate_total_distance(left_example, right_example))  # Should print 11
```

However, I notice you've presented the problem statement but haven't actually included the specific lists I'm meant to calculate the distance for. Could you provide the actual left and right lists of location IDs so I can compute their total distance?

_Prompt_:
You will be presented with one from stdin - several rows with two columns each

_Claude_:
I understand. I'll wait for the input to be provided. The problem requires me to:

Read two lists from standard input
Sort each list independently
Pair up corresponding elements from the sorted lists
Calculate the absolute difference between paired elements
Sum these differences to get the total distance

I'm ready to receive the input. Could you please paste the lists of location IDs?

_Prompt_:
Just create function that reads the lists from stdin and calculates the distance

_Claude__:
Here's a Python function that reads the lists from stdin and calculates the total distance:

```python 
def calculate_location_distance():
    # Read the lists from stdin
    left_list = []
    right_list = []
    
    # Read input until EOF or empty line
    while True:
        try:
            line = input().strip()
            if not line:
                break
            
            # Split the line and convert to integers
            left, right = map(int, line.split())
            left_list.append(left)
            right_list.append(right)
        except EOFError:
            break
    
    # Sort both lists
    left_sorted = sorted(left_list)
    right_sorted = sorted(right_list)
    
    # Calculate distances between paired elements
    distances = [abs(left - right) for left, right in zip(left_sorted, right_sorted)]
    
    # Return total distance
    return sum(distances)

# Run the function and print the result
print(calculate_location_distance())
```

This function does the following:

- Creates two empty lists: left_list and right_list
- Reads input line by line from stdin
- Splits each line into left and right integers
- Sorts both lists
- Calculates absolute differences between paired sorted elements
- Sums these differences
- Returns the total distance

When you run this, you can input the lists directly, and it will output the total distance. The function handles reading multiple lines of input until an empty line or EOF is encountered.
Would you like me to explain any part of the implementation?

--- Day 1: Historian Hysteria ---

The Chief Historian is always present for the big Christmas sleigh launch, but nobody has seen him in months! Last anyone heard, he was visiting locations that are historically significant to the North Pole; a group of Senior Historians has asked you to accompany them as they check the places they think he was most likely to visit.

You haven't even left yet and the group of Elvish Senior Historians has already hit a problem: their list of locations to check is currently empty. Eventually, someone decides that the best place to check first would be the Chief Historian's office.

For example:

3   4
4   3
2   5
1   3
3   9
3   3

Maybe the lists are only off by a small amount! To find out, pair up the numbers and measure how far apart they are. Pair up the smallest number in the left list with the smallest number in the right list, then the second-smallest left number with the second-smallest right number, and so on.

In the example list above, the pairs and distances would be as follows:

-    The smallest number in the left list is 1, and the smallest number in the right list is 3. The distance between them is 2.
-    The second-smallest number in the left list is 2, and the second-smallest number in the right list is another 3. The distance between them is 1.
-    The third-smallest number in both lists is 3, so the distance between them is 0.
-    The next numbers to pair up are 3 and 4, a distance of 1.
-    The fifth-smallest numbers in each list are 3 and 5, a distance of 2.
-    Finally, the largest number in the left list is 4, while the largest number in the right list is 9; these are a distance 5 apart.

To find the total distance between the left list and the right list, add up the distances between all of the pairs you found. In the example above, this is 2 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 5, a total distance of 11!

Your actual left and right lists contain many location IDs. What is the total distance between your lists?

Your puzzle answer was 1651298.

The first half of this puzzle is complete! It provides one gold star: *
--- Part Two ---

Your analysis only confirmed what everyone feared: the two lists of location IDs are indeed very different.

Or are they?

The Historians can't agree on which group made the mistakes or how to read most of the Chief's handwriting, but in the commotion you notice an interesting detail: a lot of location IDs appear in both lists! Maybe the other numbers aren't location IDs at all but rather misinterpreted handwriting.

This time, you'll need to figure out exactly how often each number from the left list appears in the right list. Calculate a total similarity score by adding up each number in the left list after multiplying it by the number of times that number appears in the right list.

Here are the same example lists again:

3   4
4   3
2   5
1   3
3   9
3   3

For these example lists, here is the process of finding the similarity score:

    The first number in the left list is 3. It appears in the right list three times, so the similarity score increases by 3 * 3 = 9.
    The second number in the left list is 4. It appears in the right list once, so the similarity score increases by 4 * 1 = 4.
    The third number in the left list is 2. It does not appear in the right list, so the similarity score does not increase (2 * 0 = 0).
    The fourth number, 1, also does not appear in the right list.
    The fifth number, 3, appears in the right list three times; the similarity score increases by 9.
    The last number, 3, appears in the right list three times; the similarity score again increases by 9.

So, for these example lists, the similarity score at the end of this process is 31 (9 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 9 + 9).

Once again consider your left and right lists. What is their similarity score?

_Claude_:
I'll solve Part Two by creating a function that calculates the similarity score. Here's a Python implementation:

```python
def calculate_similarity_score(left_list, right_list):
    # Count occurrences of each number in the right list
    right_counts = {}
    for num in right_list:
        right_counts[num] = right_counts.get(num, 0) + 1
    
    # Calculate similarity score
    similarity_score = 0
    for num in left_list:
        # Multiply each left number by its count in the right list
        similarity_score += num * right_counts.get(num, 0)
    
    return similarity_score

def read_location_ids():
    # Read the lists from stdin
    left_list = []
    right_list = []
    
    # Read input until EOF or empty line
    while True:
        try:
            line = input().strip()
            if not line:
                break
            
            # Split the line and convert to integers
            left, right = map(int, line.split())
            left_list.append(left)
            right_list.append(right)
        except EOFError:
            break
    
    return left_list, right_list

# Read lists and calculate similarity score
left_list, right_list = read_location_ids()
print(calculate_similarity_score(left_list, right_list))
```
This solution does the following:

- Create a count dictionary for numbers in the right list
- Iterate through the left list
- For each number in the left list, multiply it by its count in the right list
- Sum these multiplied values to get the total similarity score

The function uses a dictionary to efficiently count occurrences, and handles cases where a number from the left list might not appear in the right list by using .get(num, 0) to default to 0.

The implementation matches the problem description:

- If a number appears multiple times in the right list, it's multiplied by that count
- Numbers not in the right list contribute 0 to the score
- The final score is the sum of these multiplied values

Would you like me to explain any part of the solution?
Claude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.
